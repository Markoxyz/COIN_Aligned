## Overview

This repository contains the code and configurations used in my MSc thesis work. The project explores how architectural and theoretical modifications can improve counterfactual image generation in weakly supervised tumour segmentation using GANs.

### üîç Core Contributions
- Simplification of the COIN architecture for improved efficiency.
- Relativistic GAN loss with gradient normalization.
- Classifier-conditioned generation via latent integration.
- Reduction of training time by 2/3 compared to the baseline COIN pipeline.
- Achieved comparable or better segmentation quality without using reconstruction loss.
